        <h3>What is a Transistor?</h3>
        <p>A transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify or switch electronic signals and electrical power. It is one of the basic building blocks of modern electronic devices. Transistors can act as a switch, turning a current on or off, or as an amplifier, increasing the strength of a weak current.</p>
        <p>Transistors are made from semiconductor materials like silicon. They have at least three terminals for connection to an external circuit. A voltage or current applied to one pair of the transistor's terminals controls the current through another pair of terminals.</p>
        <p>In digital circuits, transistors are used as switches. When they are "on," they allow current to flow, representing a binary "1." When they are "off," they stop the current, representing a binary "0."</p>
        <p>Try turning the transistor on and off by clicking the block below:</p>
